This repository contains the code files and reports of two research projects (Humboldt project and bachelor thesis) at the Department of Corporate Management and Economics Chair of Economic Psychology and Leadership Ethics at Zeppelin University. The Bachelor Thesis was awarded with the VPH Förderprice (https://www.zu.de/lehrstuehle/economic-psychology/news/foerderpreis-vph.php; https://www.pressebox.de/pressemitteilung/verband-der-privaten-hochschulen-ev/Die-Gewinnerin-und-die-Gewinner-des-VPH-Foerderpreises-2021-zum-Thema-Innovation-in-Wirtschaft-Gesellschaft-wurden-bekanntgegeben/boxid/1103727)

## Description


* **Humboldt Project**: The research project examines the role of overall perceived organizational justice for the effectiveness of ethics programs. Therefore, it was investigated if overall perceived organizational justice moderates or mediates the effect of a compliance / integrity-based ethics program on deviant workplace behavior or / and organizational citizenship behavior. After drawing a theoretical basis from existing theoretical and empirical studies, moderator and mediator effects were tested by using a sample of German employees from different organizational settings (N = 329). Results of hierarchical regression analysis and the bootstrapping interval method confirmed that overall perceived organizational justice mediates the effect of compliance and integrity strategies on counterproductive work behavior. Conversely, justice perceptions did not play a role for the influence of ethics programs and organizational citizenship behavior. Also, results of regression analysis including interaction terms indicate that overall perceived organizational justice is no moderator variable for the stated relationship. Theoretical and practical implications of the results are discussed.

* **Bachelor Thesis**: Building on the Humboldt project, this research further investigates the importance of different perceived organizational justice (POJ) constructs for the effectiveness of ethics programs. It proposes that the effect of compliance / integrity strategies on deviant workplace behavior (DWB) / organizational citizenship behavior (OCB) is mediated by distributional, procedural, interpersonal, informational and / or overall POJ. Those hypotheses were developed based on existing theoretical and empirical findings and tested by the causal-step and the bootstrapping interval method. A sample of German employees from different organizational settings (N = 319) was used. Results revealed strong support for the following: 1) The positive effect of compliance strategies on DWB is mediated by distributive, interpersonal and overall POJ, 2) the negative effect of integrity strategies on DWB is mediated by all five POJ constructs and 3) the positive effect of integrity strategies on OCB is mediated by procedural and interpersonal POJ. Further, implications and limitations are discussed.
